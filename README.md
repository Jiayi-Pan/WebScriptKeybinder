# WebScriptKeybinder
This framework was built for a robotic car contest, with the hope that while allowing my none-CS friends to control the car via a web interface, they don't need to dive into web development at all.

It's a minimal framework which provides a web interface where you can evoke any server-side python script by a key press.

Configuring this framework requires no knowledge with web development, bur just writing the key-script mapping.
