# WebScriptKeybinder

It's a minimal server prividing a web interface where you can evoke any server-side python script by a key press.

Configuring this framework requires no knowledge with web development, bur just writing the key-script mapping.

This framework was built for a robotic car contest, with the hope to free my Mechnical Engineering friends from the need to do web development to write the remote control interface.
