# WebScriptKeybinder
> This framework was built for a robotic car contest, with the hope that my none-CS friends can configure the control program of the car using the universal web interface but without the need to dive into web development at all.

It's a minimal framework which provides a web interface where you can evoke any server-side python script by a key press.

Configuring this framework requires abosolutely no knowledge with web development, bur just writing the key-script mapping.
